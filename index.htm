				<h3><em><strong>About me <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-fire"></span></strong></em></h3>

				<p>During my critical age of development, I was temporarily deaf. I regained my hearing months later, but was cursed with a speech impediment and a difficulty learning new things. Because of this, I was home schooled the majority of my childhood. I eventually enrolled in a community college named Cuesta College where I got my AA Degree in General Education. After my graduation, I enrolled in BYU-Idaho where I got my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. During my time at BYU-Idaho, I took some jobs from the school where I learned more about C# and AngularJS. After I took a job as a remote developer using Laravel Framework. After working them, I realized that I needed to take a different path in my technical career. Because of this, I have decided to enroll in Epicodus. I have looked into this boot camp and I have heard many good things about it. I am hoping that I will become a better developer with your help and I look forward to working with you.</p>
